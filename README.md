# Ending Pandemics

_Ignorance and indifference are the only enemies._

These are resources to understand and actions we can take to end pandemics.

Building on Larry Brilliant's key phrase, "early detection and rapid response", ending pandemics is not only possible, but also reasonable and attainable with existing technology.

Pursuing this noble goal will also help us build worldwide awareness and community, improve healthcare infrastructure for the world's most vulnerable populations, advance the frontier of science in ecology, biology, genetics, and disease treatment, and transform our understanding of human organizations.
